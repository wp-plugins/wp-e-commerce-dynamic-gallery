== Changelog ==

= 1.1.2 - 2013/04/22 =
* Feature: Updated all plugin code to be 100% compatible with the new WP e-Commerce version 3.8.10. The plugin is backward compatible with older version to 3.8.5

= 1.1.1 - 2013/04/04 =
* Fixed: Long standing issue with Gallery main image not showing in bespoke themes in Windows 7 and Widows 8 with IE browsers 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 10.0 Desktop. Many thanks to Nemanja from the Art Binaire Team for providing the solution.
* Feature: The above fixed allowed us to complete full Gallery Optimization in Windows XP, IE 7, IE8, Windows 7, IE8 and IE9 and Windows 8, IE10 and IE10 Desktop. 
* Feature: Full Gallery test and optimization for  all 3 Windows operating systems - for these legacy browsers - Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera.
* Feature: Fully Gallery test and optimization for Apple OS X operating systems. Snow leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion using these legacy Browsers - Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera
* Feature: Full Gallery test and optimization for Apple IOS Mobile Safari in iPhones and all iPads.
* Feature: Fully Gallery test and optimization for Android Browser on all models of these manufacturers tablets that use the Android operating system - Amazon Kindle Fire, Google Nexus 7, Samsung Galaxy Note, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2
* Feature: Fully Gallery test and optimization for Android Browser on all models of these manufacturers phone that use the Android operating system (to many to list)  mobile phones that support - Samsung Galaxy, Motorola, HTC, Sony and LG
* Feature: Full Gallery test and optimization for Opera Mobile - Samsung Galaxy Tablet and Mobiles HTC Wildfire. Nokia 5800, Samsung Galaxy S II, Motorola Droid X and Motorola Atrix 4G  
* Fixed: Conflict with Chrome browser add on AdBlocker. Chrome extension Adblocker was hiding the gallery class name ad-images which was causing the main gallery images not to show. Edited style so now gallery shows with that add-on activated.
* Fixed: Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing a -1 to show in the Gallery Container instead of the current image because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin  and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Dynamic Gallery will automatically detect that and works as it should.  
* Tweak: Jumped version from 1.0.8.1 to 1.1.0 to keep in synch with the Pro Version.

= 1.0.8.1 - 2013/02/13 =

= 1.0.6 - 2012/11/23 =
* Feature: Dynamic Gallery now only recognizes image formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. It won't recognize another file and won't show in gallery, or on Image gallery manager meta box. Mean that files like PDF's can be uploaded and the gallery does not show them or on the Pro version create variations for them in the pop up image manager.
