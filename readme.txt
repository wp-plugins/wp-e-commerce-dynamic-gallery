* Fix - Conflict with Chrome browser add on AdBlocker. Chrome extension Adblocker was hiding the gallery class name ad-images which was causing the main gallery images not to show. Edited style so now gallery shows with that add-on activated.
* Fix - Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing a -1 to show in the Gallery Container instead of the current image because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin  and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Dynamic Gallery will automatically detect that and works as it should.
